/*
Problem
	Given a directed graph, design an algorithm to find out whether there is a route between two nodes 

Solution
	This  problem  can  be  solved  by  just  simple  graph  traversal,  such  as  depth  first  search  or breadth first search   
	We start with one of the two nodes and, during traversal, check if the other node is found   
	We should mark any node found in the course of the algorithm as ¡®al-ready visited¡¯ to avoid cycles and repetition of the nodes 

	public enum State {
		Unvisited, Visited, Visiting;
	}  

	public static boolean search(Graph g, Node start, Node end) {  
		LinkedList<Node> q = new LinkedList<Node>(); // operates as Stack
		for (Node u : g.getNodes()) {
			u.state = State.Unvisited;
		}
		start.state = State.Visiting;
		q.add(start);
		Node u;
		while(!q.isEmpty()) {
			u = q.removeFirst(); // i.e., pop()
			if (u != null) {
				for (Node v : u.getAdjacent()) {
					if (v.state == State.Unvisited) {
						if (v == end) {
							return true;
						} else {
							v.state = State.Visiting;
							q.add(v);
						}
					}
				}
				u.state = State.Visited;
			}
		}
		return false;
	}
